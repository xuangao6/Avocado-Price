# This is the repository for avocado price regression
## General Comments
1. you can write your code under **kunlei_avocado_price.ipynp** and I write my code under **xuan_avocado_price.ipynp**    
2. figures are stored in onedrive shared folder  
## Project Description
It is a common task to analyse the price of commodity based on a pool of potential factors. Avocado is a new and popular fruit nowadays. Yet the dynamics of its price are hidden in the data. In this project, we aim to analyse the pattern of the price data. You should try different regression methods, tune necessary parameters, and compare their performance. As a suggestion, you can try linear regression, (empirical) Bayesian linear regression, SVM regression, RVM regression, neural networks, and any other methods you prefer. In the link below, there are more description and potential notebooks which you can refer to formulate your solution.  
## Steps
1. Problem statement
2. Data pre-processing
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Split data into training data and testing data (e.g., 8:2)
5. Select models
6. Compare models
